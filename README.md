<h2 align=center>Simple Customization of KickAlerts for <a href='https://kick.com' target='_blank'>kick.com</a></h2>

<br>

<p align=center>Just localized bootstrap and axios and changed the color scheme lmao...</p>

<br>

<h3 align=center>Demo:</h3>

<h4 align=center><b><a href='https://tnyavnto.com/kick' target='_blank'>tnyavnto.com/kick</a></b></h4>

<br>

<h3 align=center>Follow my Kick:</h3>

<h4 align=center><b><a href='https://kick.com/svxy' target='_blank'>kick.com/svxy</a></b></h4>

<br>

<h4 align=center><b>So to actually put this into perspective, <a href='https://widgets.kickalerts.live/'>KickAlerts</a> is a third party service you can use through <a href='https://discord.com/invite/kickalerts'>Discord</a>, that uses an api to send kick data to endpoints for users, kick data such as current viewers, follower goals etc.. Essentially what this is, is the same endpoint you'd get from using their Viewer Count service, but with customized css, html, a custom file structure and localized scripts (not images).</b></h4>

<h3 align=center>Installation:</h3>

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Svxy/kick

cd kick

#### Now that the folder has launched in VSCode, make sure before editing any HTML or CSS, to go into 'user.js' and set the user object to your own kick username.
